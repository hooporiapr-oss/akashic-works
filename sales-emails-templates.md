**Subject:** Save $88K+ on Cognitive Training for Your Residents | Akashic Works

Hi [Facility Administrator Name],

I'm reaching out because I noticed [Facility Name] provides excellent care for seniors in [Location]. I wanted to share how our cognitive training platform could benefit your residents while dramatically reducing your activity program costs.

**The Challenge:**
Traditional cognitive therapy costs $75-150/hour per resident. For a facility like yours, that adds up to $90K-180K annually.

**Our Solution:**
Akashic Works provides unlimited cognitive training for ALL your residents for just $999-1,999/year — a 99% cost reduction.

**What Makes Us Different:**
✅ **Fully Bilingual:** English + Spanish interface (perfect for Puerto Rico)
✅ **Unlimited Sessions:** All residents can train as much as they want
✅ **6 Programs:** Memory, reaction time, pattern recognition, vocabulary
✅ **HIPAA Compliant:** Secure, encrypted data handling
✅ **Progress Reports:** Document cognitive activity for Medicare & families
✅ **Self-Directed:** Minimal staff supervision required

**Pricing:**
- Up to 25 residents: $499/year ($19.96 per resident)
- Up to 75 residents: $999/year ($13.32 per resident)
- Up to 200 residents: $1,999/year ($9.99 per resident)

**Next Steps:**
I'd love to schedule a 30-minute demo to show you exactly how Akashic Works can enhance your cognitive care program while saving your facility thousands.

**Try it free for 30 days** — no credit card required.

Are you available for a quick call this week?

## Template 2: Follow-Up (After No Response)

**Subject:** Re: Cognitive Training Demo for [Facility Name]

---

Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up on my previous email about Akashic Works' cognitive training platform.

I understand you're busy, so I'll keep this brief:

**Quick Question:** Are you currently satisfied with your cognitive activity program costs?

Most facilities spend $90K-180K/year on traditional therapy. We help reduce that to under $2K/year while providing MORE cognitive stimulation for residents.

**30-Second Overview:**
- Unlimited cognitive training for all residents
- English + Spanish bilingual
- $999-1,999/year (vs. $90K-180K traditional)
- HIPAA compliant with progress tracking
- 30-day free trial

Would a 15-minute demo make sense? I can work around your schedule.

Best,

## Objection Handling Scripts

### "We don't have the budget"
"I completely understand. That's actually why we designed Akashic Works — to make cognitive training affordable. At $999/year for 75 residents, you're spending $13.32 per resident for the entire year. Traditional therapy costs $150 per HOUR for just one resident. Would it help if I sent a cost comparison showing the ROI?"

### "Our residents aren't tech-savvy"
"Great point! That's why we made it extremely simple — just click and play. Most programs require no typing or complex navigation. Plus, your activity coordinators can assist residents who need help. During our 30-day free trial, you'll see how quickly even residents with limited tech experience get the hang of it."

### "We already have an activity program"
"That's wonderful! Akashic Works isn't meant to replace your activities — it enhances them. Think of it as another tool in your activity coordinator's toolkit. It's especially helpful for residents who prefer solo activities or during times when group activities aren't available. Plus, it provides documented cognitive activity for regulatory compliance."

### "I need to discuss with my team"
"Absolutely! Here's what I'd suggest: Start the free 30-day trial while you discuss internally. That way, your team can actually see the platform in action with your residents. No credit card required. Would that work?"

### "Let me think about it"
"Of course! Can I ask — what specific information would help you make a decision? I want to make sure you have everything you need."
